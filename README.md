## Fast Food Election
Based on open data, which fast food company would win in a presedential election? To find out I combined a dataset released by Four Square on the most popular Fast Food chains in each state and combined it with with the number of electoral votes each state. To make things slightly more interesting, I then plotted the results as electoral maps using openly available state boundary shape files.

The results of every chain would running would look like this:

Where a bipartisan race might look more like this (if I consolidated every chain besides Chick-Fil-A into a single candidate):
